## Wiki Update 2023-03-17
Hello and welcome to this new type of page: Wiki Update. A "Wiki Update" is made when I have news for everyone.
### Tiddlywiki support is added
We are happy to announce that we have another wiki software to use besides git-wiki: Tiddlywiki. Both are good. You could now use either one.
### experimental wiki software at least being considered
I might work on a custom engine in the future or fork an already existing engine. It would handle wiki linkage.
### This is what I have so far
This is the end of the wiki update. Hope to have you look at the next one.
